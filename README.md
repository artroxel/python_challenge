## PyBank

For PyBank, I was tasked with creating a python script that analyzed financial records of a company. I was given a dataset called budget_data.csv that had two columns: Date and Profit/Loss. Through my code, I calculated the total number of months, the net total of profits and losses, the changes and average of the profits and losses, the greatest increase in profits and then the greatest decrease in losses over the entire period. I then created a text file displaying all of my calculations.

## PyPoll

For PyPoll, I was tasked with creating a python script that analyzed votes in a town. I was given a dataset called election_data.csv that had three columns: Voter ID, Country, and Candidate. Through my code, I calculated the total number of votes cast, the list of candidates who received votes, percentage of votes, total votes for each candidate, and the overall winner of votes. I then created a text file displaying all of my calculations.
